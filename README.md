React:
- order of actions when creating components (first components when data)
- passing props from parent to child
- using propTypes
- passing data from child to parent
- using local component state

Flux:
- using Stores instead of props
- persistance of data in Stores
- unbinding from Store's events
- using Actions to modify Stores as opposed to direct manipulation

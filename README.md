#Example for React-flux presentation


React:
- using propTypes
- passing props from parent to child
- passing data from child to parent
- using local component state
- explain DOM diffing
- explain optimizations

Flux:
- using Stores instead of props
- persistance of data in Stores
- unbinding from Store's events
- using Actions to modify Stores as opposed to direct manipulation
- benefits of central Dispatcher

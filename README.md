#React-Flux example
========================

Hosted by github page : [http://banzay.github.io/react-flux--example/dist/](http://banzay.github.io/react-flux--example/dist/)

Setup: 
- Gulp usage (jsx and browserify)

React:
- order of actions when creating components (first components when data)
- passing props from parent to child
- using propTypes
- passing data from child to parent
- using local component state

Flux:
- using Stores instead of props
- persistance of data in Stores
- unbinding from Store's events
- using Actions to modify Stores as opposed to direct manipulation
- benefits of central Dispatcher


To run locally:
- git clone ...
- npm install
- gulp
- in browser -> localhost:3000
